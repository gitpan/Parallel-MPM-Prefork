Revision history for Parallel-MPM-Prefork

0.09  2013-08-15
* Include Perl 5.10 as requirement in Build.PL
* Don't import POSIX::_exit, we don't need it.
* Changed CLD_DATA_HDR_FMT from 'SSCL' to 'iSCL' b/c pid_t is an unsigned int.
* _read_child_data(): Absorb all remaining child data if header is corrupt.
* pf_whip_kids(), pf_kid_new(): Don't kill surplus children after they exited
  voluntarily.
* Reworked SIGCHLD handling to fix just-before-select() race condition and
  to be immune to missed SIGCHLDs.
* Removed no_sigchld_handler option, it's too messy.
* Mention POSIX::PIPE_BUF in pf_kid_yell() documentation.
* Cosmetics.
